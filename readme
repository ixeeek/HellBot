The bot won't work on your server! If you really want to use it on your server, check all files, and check channels/roles ids.

Required node modules: discord.js; moment; fs; ms; cron; random-puppy; discord-nsfw; quick.db; randomstring

WARNING: If you really really want to use it, ofc you can, but only, when you paste my github link in any (visible for users) place (e.g. bot help command).

Thank you!
